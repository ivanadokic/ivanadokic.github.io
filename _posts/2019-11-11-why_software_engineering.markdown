#### I am not a good writer. But I’ll take it this way, I am not growing if I am not challenged, and I'll write few things about why I decided to learn a robust, comprehensive software engineering curriculum.

#### A few years ago I graduated from [NYU](https://www.sps.nyu.edu/professional-pathways/diplomas.html) with Diploma in Web Design and Development. I learned webpage development skills and how to develop websites using (HTML5) and (CSS) and JavaScript Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to extend the functionality of webpages…

#### I learned how to develop website elements using scripting languages, creating content and digital media, and employing standards and technologies for B2B and B2C e-commerce websites. 

#### As I was getting more practical experience of designing and coding multipage websites I was realizing I need to learn more and more. Tons of ideas were coming up every day and I already had a solid plan and a list with the apps and functionalities I wanted to create and bring it to the next level.

> #### I needed a solution for a more dynamic website and how to connect all the features, automate processes, improve efficiency and do cool integrations without buying any solution and depend on it. I wanted to build it myself.

#### As a Mom of three kids, I had enough on my plate without going back to school over and over again. There were few things to consider in my journey to obtain a powerful technical skill-set: 

> *  #### I didn’t want to go back to the College since I got my US equivalent Master Degree in Electronic Telecommunications and Computer Science

> *  #### Neither I was looking for Ph.D.

> *  #### ![](http://)All I needed was to find the way how to learn at my own pace having on mind very busy schedule, my family, and my job. 

#### New York City offers a wide range of options, and after a few workshops and preparations, I choose one of the newest trends in learning and platform with a rigorous and powerful curriculum. Even I find it very expensive, it was the most practical one - [Online Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/coding-bootcamp/online/north-america), five months of learning software engineering solution on a platform Learn.co, and I’ll skip the inancial part for now, and ever:)))

> ####  Every time I solve something I learn something new. It’s a never-ending process. And that’s what makes me like it. 

> ####  One live and learn. 

> ####  Period.
